// 1. Build an interpolated string handler for a case of your choice.
//		As a reference you can look at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/tutorials/interpolated-string-handler
// 2. After you've build the handler use it to create a constant interpolated string and log it in the console.
// 3. Now create a record with at least two properties
//		3.1. Create a ToString() on the record
//		3.2. Seal the ToString() of the record
//		3.3. Create a new record inheriting from your record from before
//			3.3.1. Log the ToString() output of a instance of your record in the console
//			3.3.2. Deconstruct an instance of your record in at least one existing and one newly defined variable

Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
